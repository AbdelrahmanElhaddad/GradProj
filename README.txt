Yo wussup mr Reader!

Docs&Resources contains..well..The documentations and the resources needed for the project and the required research. In it you'll find videos and research papers used for the project and the research.

The two main research areas at the moment are Camera Calibration and Depth Estimation for the ultimate goal of estimating the distance between any given car and any given human that's around.

Programming languages used will be python mainly and perhaps we may need some C++.
Main frameworks and packages used will be Torch, OpenCV, Numpy, Matplotlib, and SciKit-Learn and we may use other frameworks in the future as we continue the research and implementation. Ah yes, almost forgot, and a physical chessboard xD.

We'll probably use YOLO for object detection and Depth Anything for depth estimation but we're still researching.

Frameworks and their versions can be found in requirements.txt
